These numbers are evenly distributed along a linear scale, making it convenient for creating plots or performing numerical computations over a specific range.\n",

The points on the scatter plot are colored according to the species of penguins using the `hue` parameter. \n",

Overall, this code snippet creates a visual representation of the relationship between bill length and body mass among penguins, categorized by species, and overlays a best-fit line to highlight any linear trends in the data.\n",

    "Finally the line of code corrcoef() calculates a number that tells us how closely related two things are in a straight-line way. Specifically, it's looking at how closely bill length and body mass of penguins are related. The number it gives us helps us understand if changes in one thing (like bill length) tend to go along with changes in the other thing (like body mass). If the number is close to 1, it means there's a strong positive relationship, while if it's close to -1, it means there's a strong negative relationship. If it's around 0, it means there's not much of a relationship at all."
