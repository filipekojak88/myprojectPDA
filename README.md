# myprojectPDA      

This repository contains a project completed for the module of Principles of Data Analytics in ATU with the lecturer Ian McLoughlin.    
Througout this project there were several Python scripts that were used in Jupyter notebook to highlight the different skills acquired during the course.   
This README has been written with [Github's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind [[1]](#1).     
MarkDown was used in this README file and was based on [in GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) [[2]](#2).       

## About This Project

In this project an analysis has been completed using the data from Palmer Penguins dataset.

The Palmer Penguins dataset is like a treasure trove of information about penguins living near Antarctica. It helps scientists understand how male and female penguins differ in what they eat and how they hunt for food, especially when there's less sea ice around. By studying their diets and body sizes, researchers can figure out why males and females might prefer different hunting spots [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4).      

This dataset is super handy because it's not just for scientists—it's also great for teaching and learning about data analysis. It's like replacing an old, not-so-interesting dataset with something way cooler and more relevant. Plus, it's been downloaded tons of times, showing how popular and useful it is for anyone wanting to explore the world of data science [[5]](#5).     

This data was collected near the Palmer Station in Antarctica from penguins:        
- on three different islands: Dream, Torgersen and Biscoe.

*Palmer Station in Antarctica* [[6]](#6)     

- From three difference species: Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie.    

![Penguins](images/penguins.png)    
*Penguins species: Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae)*  [[7]](#7) [[8]](#8) [[9]](#9)       

- 4 measurements were taken from each penguin: body mass (g), bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), and flipper length (mm).

The Jupyter notebook [penguins.ipynb](jupyter.ipynb) displays the data analysis completed using the Palmer Penguins dataset.         
The penguin csv file used for this analysis was from the [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/README.md)'s repository as recommended on the Assessment Instructions for the module of Principles of Data Analytics [[11]](#11).
