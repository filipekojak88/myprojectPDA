This repository has a project for the module of Principles of Data Analytics
This README has been written with [Github's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
You should refer to that documentation for more information on writing an appropriate README for visitors to your repository.

## About This Project

In this project an analysis is completed using the data from Palmer Penguins Dataset.

The Palmer Penguins dataset is like a treasure trove of information about penguins living near Antarctica. It helps scientists understand how male and female penguins differ in what they eat and how they hunt for food, especially when there's less sea ice around. By studying their diets and body sizes, researchers can figure out why males and females might prefer different hunting spots [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2).    
This dataset is super handy because it's not just for scientists—it's also great for teaching and learning about data analysis. It's like replacing an old, not-so-interesting dataset with something way cooler and more relevant. Plus, it's been downloaded tons of times, showing how popular and useful it is for anyone wanting to explore the world of data science [[3]](#3).      
The dataset contains three difference species:

*<span style="font-size:0.5em;">Penguins species: Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae)</span>* [[4]](4) [[5]](5) [[6]](6)
